# Barrelhunt
Code for Barrelhunt, a custom ZPS gamemode

Please note that this plugin is rather simple and has been rewritten as to not interfere with other plugins or methods/variables from other plugins. 
This plugin can be run on a server without too much worry as it only triggers with maps that have "barrelhunt" or "bhm" in the map name. However, you can remove this restriction and recompile the plugin yourself.
